### OverView 

To retrieve the data that will power this app, you'll need to send requests to the Bands in Town, Spotify and OMDB APIs. You'll find these Node packages crucial for your assignment.

   * [Node-Spotify-API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-spotify-api)

   * [Request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request)

     * You'll use Request to grab data from the [OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com) and the [Bands In Town API](http://www.artists.bandsintown.com/bandsintown-api)

   * [Moment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment)

   * [DotEnv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
   
   
   This will be the line of code you will be using to downloaded the required packages
   ```
   npm install node-spotify-api request moment dotenv
   ```
### Requirements

   * Step One: Visit <https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/>

   * Step Two: Either login to your existing Spotify account or create a new one (a free account is fine) and log in.

   * Step Three: Once logged in, navigate to <https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications/create> to register a new application to be used with the Spotify API. You can fill in whatever you'd like for these fields. When finished, click the "complete" button.

   * Step Four: On the next screen, scroll down to where you see your client id and client secret. Copy these values down somewhere, you'll need them to use the Spotify API and the [node-spotify-api package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-spotify-api).

  * Step One Go to the [BandsInTown API](https://manager.bandsintown.com/support/bandsintown-api) 
  * Step Two Scroll down tot he Step-by-Step section and there you can request and API key
  
* OMDB:

  * Step Two fill out the required information to receive API key
  
### Instructions
  
1. Navigate to the root of your project and run `npm init -y` &mdash; this will initialize a `package.json` file for your project. The `package.json` file is required for installing third party npm packages and saving their version numbers. If you fail to initialize a `package.json` file, it will be troublesome, and at times almost impossible for anyone else to run your code after cloning your project.

2. Next, create a file named `.env`, add the following to it, replacing the values with your API keys (no quotes) once you have them:

```js
# Spotify API Keys
SPOTIFY_ID = <Your Spotify ID>
SPOTIFY_SECRET= <Your Spotify Secret>

#Bands-In-Town API Keys

BANDS_ID = <Your API key>

#OMDB API Keys

OMDB_API = <Your API key>
```
